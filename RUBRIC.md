| Category | Weight | What to Look For |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Architecture & Design** | 25% | Modular, extensible, separation of concerns, clear abstractions (rule engine, reporting, config loading). |
| **Code Quality & Standards** | 20% | Consistent style; readable, documented, idiomatic; linting or type-checking enabled. |
| **Testing & Automation** | 20% | Meaningful test coverage; mocks/stubs where appropriate; CI present. |
| **Documentation & Clarity** | 15% | README explains design, usage, tradeoffs; setup is straightforward. |
| **Functionality & Completeness** | 15% | Meets core requirements; handles edge cases gracefully. |
| **Bonus / Innovation** | 5% | CI integration, plugin architecture, parallelism, HTML reporting, etc. |

## Scoring Scale
- **5** – Exceptional / polished, production-quality thought
- **4** – Strong, clean, extensible
- **3** – Adequate but rough edges
- **2** – Functional but lacks rigor
- **1** – Poorly structured or incomplete
